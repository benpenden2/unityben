# unityben
trying unity:
used version 6.3(6000.3.3f1)
the given tutorial was pretty comprehensive in and itself, teaching me about the making objects, using assets, textures etc.
But, i wasnt able to publish the tutorial game, which upon some research, was the versions bug, which was said by the developers to be fixed in the next update
ie, update(6000.5.3..)
overall good for beginners. with practice, will be very handy and user firendly to use .
